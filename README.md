# Making a To-Do app to acquire skills and knowledge.

I used React, NextJs, tailwindCss in this project.

## Main takeaways are:

- You can use LocalStorage Api to store data in your device.
- useEffect = useEffect runs on every render of the component (i.e when a state variable changes) and can also run every time a specific value changes that is mentioned in it's dependency array
- The map function in JavaScript is used to transform an array. Think of it like a factory line: each item in an array goes in, gets processed or changed, and then comes out as a new item. In the end, you get a new array with all the items transformed in the same way.
